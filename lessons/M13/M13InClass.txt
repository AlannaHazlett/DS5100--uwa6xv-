Hi! I attended today's class discussing agile. Tim talked about issues with the iron triangle and scope. Ryan talked about how he thought that the waterfall method felt the most unrestrictive creatively. Victor talked about some issues he runs into in the car industry. 

Thanks for a great first semester in the online MSDS program!
